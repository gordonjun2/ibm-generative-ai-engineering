This could involve tasks like translation, text summarization, sentiment analysis, or any other action that requires specialized software or data. The model or application would send a request to the tool, the tool would process the request, and then return the result back to the application. This type of interaction allows for a more comprehensive and powerful set of functionalities. \n",

This approach is commonly used to enhance AI capabilities without the need for the model to be an expert in every field.\n"

    "## Orchestrating multiple tools with an agent: Mathematical toolkit\n",
    "In real-world applications, a single tool is often insufficient to address the complexity and diversity of user requests. Tasks such as data analysis, performing calculations, or retrieving specific information require specialized capabilities that cannot be fulfilled by a single function. By equipping an agent with multiple tools, each tailored to a distinct purpose, you'll create a system that can dynamically select and utilize the appropriate tool based on the user’s query. This approach enhances the flexibility and scalability of the AI, allowing it to handle a broad spectrum of tasks with precision and efficiency. The orchestration of multiple tools ensures that the agent can seamlessly manage complex workflows, making it an essential framework for building robust and versatile AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this concept, let’s create additional tools, i.e, a mathematical toolkit. In addition to the addition tool, you will now create tools for subtraction, multiplication, and division. These tools will be integrated into an agent capable of handling various mathematical queries, showcasing how multiple tools can work together within a single AI system.\n",

    "The current functions would benefit from enhanced error handling and input validation. The add_numbers, subtract_numbers, multiply_numbers, and divide_numbers functions should be updated to handle decimal numbers using float conversion, validate inputs more strictly, and provide clear error messages for edge cases. For example, divide_numbers should explicitly check for division by zero, and all functions should gracefully handle non-numeric inputs like \"two\" or \"hundred\". The test cases should be expanded beyond basic operations to include edge cases like divided by zero, empty inputs, and mixed numeric/text inputs (e.g., \"divide one hundred by 5\"). Also consider adding tests for decimal numbers (e.g., \"multiply 3.5 by 2\") and sequential operations (e.g., \"multiply 10 by 2 then add 5\"). This comprehensive testing approach ensures the agent can handle a wide range of real-world mathematical queries.\n"

       "'Page: Cold calling\\nSummary: Cold calling is the solicitation of business from potential customers who have had no prior contact with the salesperson conducting the call. It is an attempt to convince potential customers to purchase the salesperson\\'s product or service.  Generally, it is an over-the-phone process, making it a form of telemarketing, but can also be done in-person by door-to-door salespeople.  Though cold calling can be used as a legitimate business tool, scammers can use cold calling as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: What Is a Woman?\\nSummary: What Is a Woman? is a 2022 American documentary film about gender and transgender issues, directed by Justin Folk and presented by conservative political commentator Matt Walsh. The film was released by conservative website The Daily Wire. In the film, Walsh asks various people \"What is a woman?\" with the goal of showing them that their definition of womanhood is circular. Walsh said he made the film in opposition to \"gender ideology\". It is described in many sources as anti-trans or transphobic. The film was released to subscribers of The Daily Wire on June 1, 2022, coinciding with the start of Pride Month.\\nThe film received mixed reviews. Walsh\\'s approach garnered praise from conservative commentators, while drawing criticism from other sources, including advocates of transgender healthcare. According to transgender activists and others who appeared in the film, Walsh had invited individuals to participate in the film under false pretenses. Walsh\\'s tour to showcase the film at college campuses sparked protests. In June 2023, during the subsequent Pride Month, the film gained further attention when Elon Musk promoted it on Twitter. The title, \"What is a woman?\", has become a widespread rhetorical question in anti-trans discourse. \\n\\n\\n\\nPage: WhatsApp\\nSummary: WhatsApp (officially WhatsApp Messenger) is an American social media, instant messaging (IM), and voice-over-IP (VoIP) service owned by technology conglomerate Meta. It allows users to send text, voice messages and video messages, make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other content. WhatsApp\\'s client application runs on mobile devices, and can be accessed from computers. The service requires a cellular mobile telephone number to sign up. WhatsApp was launched in February 2009. In January 2018, WhatsApp released a standalone business app called WhatsApp Business which can communicate with the standard WhatsApp client.\\nThe service was created by WhatsApp Inc. of Mountain View, California, which was acquired by Facebook in February 2014 for approximately US$19.3 billion. It became the world\\'s most popular messaging application by 2015, and had more than 2 billion users worldwide by February 2020, with WhatsApp Business having approximately 200 million monthly users by 2023. By 2016, it had become the primary means of Internet communication in regions including the Americas, the Indian subcontinent, and large parts of Europe and Africa.\\n\\n'"

      "Summary: Canada ranks 37th by population among countries of the world, comprising about 0.5% of the world's total, with about 41.5 million Canadians as of 2024. Despite being the second-largest country by total area (fourth-largest by land area), the vast majority of the country is sparsely inhabited, with most of its population south of the 55th parallel north. Just over 60 percent of Canadians live in just two provinces: Ontario and Quebec. Though Canada's overall population density is low, many regions in the south, such as the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, have population densities higher than several European countries. Canada has six population centres with more than one million people: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa.\n",
      "The large size of Canada's north, which is currently not arable, and thus cannot support large human populations, significantly lowers the country's carrying capacity. In 2021, the population density of Canada was 4.2 people per square kilometre. \n",
      "The historical growth of Canada's population is complex and has been influenced in many different ways, such as Indigenous populations, expansion of territory, and human migration. Immigration has been, and remains, the most important factor in Canada's population growth. The 2021 Canadian census counted a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 per cent over the 2016 figure. Between 1990 and 2008, the population increased by 5.6 million, equivalent to 20.4 per cent overall growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Population of Canada by province and territory\n",
      "Summary: Canada is divided into 10 provinces and three territories. The majority of Canada's population is concentrated in the areas close to the Canada–US border. Its four largest provinces by area (Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta) are also its most populous; together they account for 86.5 percent of the country's population. The territories (the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon) account for over a third of Canada's area but are home to only 0.32 percent of its population, which skews the national population density value.\n",
      "Canada's population grew by 5.24 percent between the 2016 and 2021 censuses. With the exceptions of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Northwest Territories, all territories and provinces increased in population from 2016 to 2021. In terms of percent change, the fastest-growing province or territory was Yukon with an increase of 12.1 percent between 2016 and 2021, followed by Prince Edward Island with 7.99 percent growth.\n",
      "Generally, provinces steadily grew in population along with Canada. However, some provinces such as Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador experienced long periods of stagnation or population decline. Ontario and Quebec were always the two most populous provinces in Canada, with over 60 percent of the population at any given time. The demographic importance of the West steadily grew over time, while the importance of Atlantic Canada steadily slipped. Canada's population has increased every year since Confederation in 1867: see List of population of Canada by year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: List of the largest population centres in Canada\n",
      "Summary: A population centre, in the context of a Canadian census, is a populated place, or a cluster of interrelated populated places, which meets the demographic characteristics of an urban area, having a population of at least 1,000 people and a population density of no fewer than 400 people per square km2.\n",
      "The term was introduced in the Canada 2011 Census; prior to that, Statistics Canada used the term urban area.\n",
      "Statistics Canada listed 944 population centres in its 2011 census data; 513 of them, 54 per cent of all population centres in Canada, were located in Ontario or Quebec, the two most populous provinces.\n",
